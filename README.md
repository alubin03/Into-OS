In this lab I used GoBuster to brute-force a fake bank application called FakeBank and gain access to hidden pages and directories. The goal is to find a secret bank transfer page that allows transferring money between accounts at the bank.

This tought me fundamental concepts of ethical hacking, including reconnaissance and vulnerability analysis. The attacker(me) uses GoBuster to scan the website with a list of potential pages and directories to find hidden pages that show or give access to admin controls or sensitive data, such as the secret bank transfer page.

I learned about the importance of ethical hacking. Hacking can be a sensitive topic, but ethical hacking plays a crucial role in identifying security vulnerabilities and improving security measures. Ethical hacking is legal and is done with the intent of enhancing security measures, rather than exploiting them maliciously. This lab was quick and fun. Definetly recommend.

Until next time‚úåüèΩ
